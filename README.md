# MongODM - Simplest ODM there is

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tshelburne/mongodm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tshelburne/mongodm)


## Description

MongODM is a simple, low-key interface for mapping a model to a collection. The source code can be understood in an afternoon. It's great for kick-starting a really simple project, or for getting your ideas down quickly before going for a full-blown, feature-heavy solution.


## Features

- POJO registration 
- ActiveRecord-like interface extension
- Relations
- Evented lifecycle


## Installation

`npm install mongodm`


## Usage

Create a simple POJO model:

	var Article = module.exports = function(title, body, date) {
		this.title = title;
		this.body  = body;
		this.date  = date;
	}

Map the model to a collection:

	var odm = require('mongodm')('localhost', 27017, 'my-db-name'),
	  , Article = require('./models/articles');

	// this reads the persistable properties from a constructed instance
	odm.map(Article, 'articles');

	// alternatively, you can specify the properties to persist
	odm.map(Article, 'articles', 'title', 'date');

Access the models from the odm object:

	odm.articles.find('some-id', function(err, article) {
		// do something spectacular
	});

Or from the model constructor (ActiveRecord-like interface):

	Article.find('some-id', function(err, article) {
		// well that's kind of neat
	});

The interface is simple:

	odm.articles.find(idOrObjectQuery, function(err, article) { ... })
	odm.articles.all(function(err, articles) { ... })
	odm.articles.save(article, function(err, article) { ... }) // insert and update
	odm.articles.destroy(article, function(err, numRmvd) { ... })
	odm.articles.destroyAll(function(err, numRmvd) { ... })

	// model constructor API
	Article.find(idOrObjectQuery, function(err, article) { ... })
	Article.all(function(err, articles) { ... })
	Article.create({ ... }, function(err, articles) { ... })
	Article.destroyAll(function(err, numRmvd) { ... })

	// model instance API
	article.save(function(err, article) { ... }) // insert and update
	article.destroy(function(err, numRmvd) { ... })
	article.id() // as an alternative to article._id


## Relations

This interface is still evolving, since it depends pretty heavily on the odm.{mapper} syntax, and there is little in the way of convenience. However, it does the job, and shipped is better than perfect! I don't anticipate deprecating this version anytime soon, but it will be extended to read more nicely (using constructors, fewer required arguments, etc.).

As before, we create our models:

	var Article = module.exports = function(author, title, body, date) {
		this.author   = author;
		this.comments = [];

		this.title  = title;
		this.body   = body;
		this.date   = date;
	}

	var User = module.exports = function(username) {
		this.username = username;
		this.articles = [];
	}

	var Comment = module.exports = function(author, body) {
		this.author = author;
		this.body   = body;
	}

Map the models to collections:

	odm.map(Article, 'articles');
	odm.map(User, 'users');
	odm.map(Comment, 'comments');

Map the relationships between models:

	odm.articles.hasOne(odm.authors, 'author');

Or, with a little more class...

	Article.hasOne(odm.authors, 'author');
	Article.containsMany(odm.comments, 'comments');

	Author.findsMany(odm.articles, 'articles', 'author');

	Comment.hasOne(odm.authors, 'author');

Now when you load a model, it will have all relationships eagerly populated. The interface here is simple as well:
	
- These define embedded models, and ensure we get instances of the model class rather than just objects:
	
		Article.containsOne(odm.authors, 'author');
		Article.containsMany(odm.authors, 'authors');

	Example stored documents:
	- in db.articles: `{ title: 'some title', author: { username: 'tshelburne' } }`

- These define relationships where the relation stores the article ID in the foreign key:
	
		Article.findsOne(odm.authors, 'author', 'article');
		Article.findsMany(odm.authors, 'authors', 'article');

	Example stored documents:
	- in db.articles: `{ title: 'some title' }`
	- in db.authors: `{ username: 'tshelburne', article: '1234' }`
	
- These define relationships where the article stores the relation ID:
	
		Article.hasOne(odm.authors, 'author');
		Article.hasMany(odm.authors, 'authors');

	Example stored documents:
	- in db.articles: `{ title: 'some title', author: '1234' }`
	- in db.authors: `{ username: 'tshelburne' }`

	It should be noted that `hasOne` and `hasMany` relationships *do not* ensure the relation is persisted, so save the relation first.

## Finding by `all`

In addition to a callback, `all` accepts two optional arguments as the first parameters: `query` and `options`. These are the same as in the [low-level driver](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/master/Readme.md#find).

Note: If you only want to pass in the options object, you must pass an empty query object as well - `Model.all({}, {sort: {prop: 'weight'}}, cb)`


## Constructor arguments

Any values stored in the database document are mapped to an instance of your model created with `new Model()`. However, if you need to call the constructor in a specific way, you can override this on the odm interface with the `new` function:

	odm.articles.new = function(doc) {
		return new Article(doc.body); // maybe our Article generates a summary at instantiation
	}


## Events

Both the ODM object and the model emit lifecycle events that can be listened to with the following interface:

	odm.articles.on('event', function(article) { ... })

	Article.on('event', function(article) { ... })

The events that are fired are:

- `creating` | `created`
- `updating` | `updated`
- `saving` | `saved` (for both create and update actions)
- `destroying` | `destroyed` (`destroy` only, not on `destroyAll`)


## Tests

1. `mongod`
1. `npm test`

The code interface is decently tested, since it's so small. The tests are currently depending on the proper functioning of mongoskin - not too excited about that, but I'd rather see the library actually working with the database than mock out calls at this low level.
